*(Laid off in 2024-12)*

-   Designed and built CI system using Temporal, Bazel, and Go for running 50K
    tests in polyglot mega repo which reduced pressure and cost on existing CI
    (which was resource-constrained, expensive, and experiencing frequent
    outages).
-   Designed an auditing and provenance system for builds and tests that would
    also improve build times and test reliability by logging all egress from
    build and test containers and redirecting dependency fetching traffic to
    internal cache. Cost savings were estimated to be \$200K per month to start.

Built [Dodder](https://github.com/friedenberg/dodder), a Git-like version
control system for Zettelkasten knowledge management in Go, featuring:

-   Content-addressable storage with append-only object graph allowing multiple
    versions to coexist and satisfy concurrent build graphs
-   Cryptographic signing and verification of objects across distributed
    repositories with ZSTD compression and Age encryption
-   Sophisticated query engine supporting tags, full-text search, and Lua
    scripting integration
-   Highly-modular architecture with pool-based memory management and custom
    binary index format for optimized IO
-   HTTP/Unix socket API server with mTLS, remote synchronization, and
    cross-repository operations
-   Git-style CLI (clone/push/pull/diff) with shell completion and comprehensive
    BATS/unit testing
