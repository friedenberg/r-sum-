*(Laid off in 2024-12)*

-   Designed and built a CI system using Temporal and Bazel for running 50K
    tests in polyglot mega repo which reduced pressure and cost on existing CI
    (which was resource-constrained, expensive, and experiencing frequent
    outages).
-   Designed an auditing and provenance system for builds and tests that would
    also improve build times and test reliability by logging all egress from
    build and test containers and redirecting dependency fetching traffic to
    internal cache. Cost savings were estimated to be \$200K per month to start.
